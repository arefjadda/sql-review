# SQL Review
This repository contains a review of some of the most frequently used SQL syntax. It contains basic functions all the way up to advanced SQL. It isn't much of an interesting project to look through, however it serves as a good SQL cheat sheet to review the syntax. I worked with the open-source MySQL RDBMS for this review so some of the syntax might vary slightly when using other relational database management systems.

The csv files used for this review session were collected from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [SuperDataScience](https://www.superdatascience.com/) websites and can be accessed through the links below:
